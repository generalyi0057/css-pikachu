# CSS Pikachu

## Inspiration

It has been a long since last time I write a program.

When I was still working in a company, I once saw my colleague used css to draw Pikachu. After that, I always wanted to write one myself tho I kept forgetting it. (๑>؂<๑）

June 7th, 2019, on the spur of the moment, I decided to make a pikachu... and review css.
